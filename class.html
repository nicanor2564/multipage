          cardio movements come together with elements of core strengthening to make 22 a dynamic, exciting

              pyramid is a fun, intense test of your cardio capacity. Don’t underestimate the simplicity of this 6-station
              session; Abacus will leave you drenched and gasping, asking where all those inches on your waistline disappeared to.</p>

            <p>Bears is a staple F45 cardio-based session that relies on explosive, plyometric training using

          <p>Resistance training is an essential for building both muscle mass and bone density. Our strength

            to target power and stabilization for a solid base of functional strength, resulting in stronger,
            leaner, more defined muscles.</p>

            enhanced athleticism, improving a your more explosive movements like running and jumping. The burn
            doesn’t stop after the session ends, as that lean muscle fiber will keep you torching calories long
